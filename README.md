# Slither.IO_ML

Final project created at Google Computer Science Summer Institute in collaboration with Ojasw Upadhyay, Carlos Georgescu, and Ash Gupta and advised by senior software engineers Becky O' Sullivan and Yeon Joon Lin.

Game uses advanced techniques like linear interpolation and the Box-Muller Transform to simulate gameplay smoothly and accurately. Snake is controlled using either the user's mouse placement or hand movement detected by the camera (teachable machine ML). Bots are controlled through artificial intelligence and heuristics. Multiplayer gaming is currently in progress!
